# Stock Tracker
This is my submission for Comp333 Assignment one. It is a single page web application for tracking the performance of various stocks.
The information contained in the demo is purely fictional. 

### How it works:
For this assignment we were to create a single page web application to display stock information. 
We were not allowed to use any libraries or frameworks.
I took some inspiration from ReactJS and designed a system of reusable components to build my interface with and created a series of view controller objects in charge of rendering various parts of the application.

### What I learned:
Working on this project I got really involved with directly manipulating the DOM, and customising elements using their object properties.
Through this process I went from DOM novice to very confident in my understanding and practical knowledge.

I also learned how much I appreciate frameworks like React for speeding up the development process, so I am glad I learned how to do it "the hard way" first.

# Live demo
A live demo is available below. It has been modified to work without the PHP backend and MySql database.
